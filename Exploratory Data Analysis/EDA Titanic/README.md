# EDA on Titanic dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process, and it involves examining and visualizing the dataset to gain insights into its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables. 

### Let's discuss how EDA can be conducted on the Titanic dataset without diving into the actual code:

1. Understanding the Dataset:
Start by loading the Titanic dataset and understanding its structure. Look at the first few rows to get an idea of the data types, features, and values present.

2. Overview of Features:
Identified the features in the dataset, such as 'Pclass' (Passenger Class), 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp' (Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard), 'Parch' (Number of Parents/Children Aboard), 'Fare' (Ticket Fare), etc.

3. Summary Statistics:
Calculated summary statistics like mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for numerical features. This provides a quick overview of the central tendency and spread of the data.

4. Data Distribution:
Visualize the distribution of numerical features using histograms. This helps in understanding the spread and identifying potential outliers.

5. Categorical Feature Analysis:
Explored the distribution of categorical features, such as 'Sex' and 'Embarked' (Port of Embarkation). Use bar charts to visualize the counts in each category.

6. Survival Rate:
Investigated the overall survival rate in the dataset. This involves calculating the percentage of passengers who survived and visualizing it.

7. Survival by Class and Gender:
Explore survival rates based on different factors like passenger class ('Pclass') and gender ('Sex'). This could involve creating bar charts or using pivot tables.

8. Age Distribution:
Analyzed the distribution of passenger ages. Look for patterns and consider dealing with missing values in the 'Age' feature.

9. Correlation Analysis:
Explored the correlation between numerical features. This helped in identification of relationships between variables that can be visualized using a correlation matrix or heatmap.

10. Missing Values:
Identified features with missing values and took decision to handle them. This involved imputation and dropping certain rows and columns.

By systematically going through these steps, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of the Titanic dataset, laying the foundation for more advanced analyses and modeling. EDA is not just about generating visuals; it's about extracting meaningful insights that inform subsequent steps in the data science pipeline.
